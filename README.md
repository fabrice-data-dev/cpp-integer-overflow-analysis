# C++ Integer Overflow Analysis

## Overview

This academic C++ project focuses on **integer overflow and capacity limits** in C++.
It demonstrates how numerical overflows can occur, the risks they introduce, and how they can lead to unexpected or incorrect program behavior.

The project was developed as part of a **academic coursework** on C++ fundamentals, robustness, and low-level behavior.

---

## Objectives

- Understand integer limits in C++ (`int`, `long`, etc.)
- Demonstrate integer overflow scenarios
- Highlight undefined or unexpected behaviors
- Apply safer programming practices to prevent numerical errors

---

## Technologies

- C++
- Standard C++ libraries
- Development environments:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Visual Studio
  - Any C++ compatible IDE or compiler

## How to Run the Project

This project must be executed in a **C++ development environment**.

### Option 1 — Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Open the folder:
   ```
   cpp-integer-overflow-analysis_GitHub_Ready
   ```
3. Ensure a C++ compiler is installed (e.g. `g++`)
4. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ src/ProjetAO.cpp -o overflow_demo
   ```
5. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./overflow_demo
   ```

---

### Option 2 — Using Visual Studio

1. Open **Visual Studio**
2. Create or open a **C++ Console Application**
3. Add `ProjetAO.cpp` from the `src/` folder to the project
4. Build and run the application

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Integer capacity limits
- Overflow behavior in arithmetic operations
- Silent numerical errors
- Defensive programming strategies in C++

---

## Academic Context

This project is an **academic reconstruction** based on a 2024 C++ coursework.
It is intended for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes.

---

## Notes

- Build artifacts are intentionally excluded from version control
- The project is designed for local execution
- No external dependencies are required

---

## Conclusion

This project illustrates essential C++ concepts related to numerical reliability and robustness.
It complements higher-level projects by demonstrating a solid understanding of low-level behavior and safe coding practices.
